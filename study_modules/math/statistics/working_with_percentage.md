## 1. What is percentage?

A percentage is a measure that represents a proportion out of 100 parts. It is commonly used to express a part of a whole in a relation to the total.

**Examples: **
- "50% off" means half the original price
- "25% salaray decrease" indicates a quarter decrease from the current salary.

## 2. How to calculate a percentage of a number?

To calculate a percentage of a number, you multiply the number by the fraction corresponding to the percentage in decimal form.

**Example: **

To calculate 20% of 100:
You should multiply 100 by 0.2, resulting in 20.

## 3. How to find the total value when knowing a percentage

If you know a percentage and a part of the total value, you can find the total value by dividing the part by the corresponding percentage.

**Example: **

If 40 is 25% of a number:
We divide 40 by 0.25 (or multiply by 4), resulting in 160 as the total value.

## 4. How to find he percentage between two numbers?

To find the percentage between two numbers, divide the part by the total and multiply by 100.

**Example: **

If 20 is 25% of a number 40 is 50% of the same number:
20 is half of 50, or 50% of 40, indicating that 20 is 50% of the total.
