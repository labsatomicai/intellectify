title: "Introduction to financial mathematics: Simple and compound interest"
---

Financial mathematics is an essential area in our daily lives, by studying its concepts we're able to
understand how financial operations work. In this modules, you'll find concepts that are related to 
simple and compound interest, which are fundamental if want to know about return on investments and loans.

## 1. Simple interest

Simple interest is calculated using the initial amount of capital invested or borrowed. The formula is
written like this:

$$ J = C*i*n $$

Where:
+ `J` represents the amount of interest;
+ `C` is the initial capital;
+ `i` is the interest rate (in decimal form);
+ `n` is the time period

## 2. Compound interest

Compound interest is calculated using the initial capital plus the accumulated interest until now. The formula
is written in this way:

$$ M = C*(1+i)^n $$

Where:
- `M` represents the total amount (accumulated value);
- `C` is the initial capital;
- `i` is the interest rate (in decimal form);
- `n` is the time period

## Examples

Suppose that you have $1000.00 to invet at an interest rate of 15% per year for 5 years.

**Simple interest:**

$$ J = 1000*0.15*5 = 750 $$

The simple interest value would be $750.00.

**Compound interest:**

$$ M = 1000*(1+0.15)^5 \approx 2011.35 $$

The accumulated amount after 5 years would be approximately $2011.35.
