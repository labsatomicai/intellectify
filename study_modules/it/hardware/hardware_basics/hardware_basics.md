## Overview

Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system, in other words, the parts of the
computer that you can kick.

## What is inside of a computer?

### 1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is often seen as the "brain" of the computer. It runs instructions stored in the computer's memory, execute
calculations and controls data movement.

### 2. Random Access Memory (RAM)

RAM is a type of volatile memory, so, it temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to execute as 
fast as possible. It permits quicker read and write operations, enabling multitasking.

### 3. Storage devices

Storage devices are used to store data permanently or temporarily. To exemplify: hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state
drives (SSDs).

### 4. Motherboard

The motherboard is the fundamental piece of a computer. It provides electrical connections between the CPU, RAM, storage
and other components.

### 5. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

The GPU is reponsible for showing images and graphics on a computer monitor. It's commonly associated to gaming, video
editing and other graphic-intesive tasks.

## Importance of understanding computer hardware

Understanding computer hardware is crucial for various reasons:

+ Troubleshooting hardware issues;
+ Upgrading computer components;
+ Building custom computer systems;
+ Optimiznig computer performance;
+ Enhancing compatibility with software applications.
